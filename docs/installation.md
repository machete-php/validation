# Installation

## System Requirements

You need PHP >= 5.6.0 to use this package but the latest stable version of PHP is recommended.

## Composer

This package is installed using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```bash
$ composer require league/json-guard
```

If your schema contains JSON References, you probably want to install [league/json-reference](json-reference/installation) too.
